## Usage

To use my study guide, feel free to review the notes in each section. Not sure what to look at first? Let the Guide guide you! Open Chrome DevTools with Control+Shift+I! A console panel should open either to the side or the bottom of the webpage inside the browser. At the bottom of the topic list, the Guide should have a suggestion for you! Huzzah!
